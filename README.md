carousel
========
There are hundreds of carousels on the web. The designers in my company love them to death. They put carousels on everthing. My approach would always be to download a crousel and try and integrate it into my project but their will always be something that doesn't quite fit. So this is my attempt at writting a reuseable, scaleable responsive carousel with thumbnails, indecators of your position, frame counter, full screen, magnify  glass and quick preview of previous and next frame
